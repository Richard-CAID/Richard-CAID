- 👋 Hi, I’m @Richard-CAID
- 👀 I’m interested in working with Indigenous Peoples to provide needed administrative capacity to support them in consultations with colonial governments over rights and land.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use emacs/spacemacs to help provide document support and logs needed for information management in consultations and negotiations. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on resolving application problems that hinder information management for remote Indigenous communities with limited human resource capacity.
- 📫 How to reach me -> rherbert.caid@gmail.com
